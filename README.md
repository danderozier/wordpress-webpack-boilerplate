# Wordpress Theme Boilerplate w/ Webpack

This is a very simple Wordpress boilerplate theme that uses Webpack to compile
Javascript and Sass.

## Install
In your Wordpress theme folder:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/danderozier/wordpress-webpack-boilerplate
$ yarn install
$ yarn run watch
```

## Usage
Javascript will compile to dist/main.min.js, and Sass will compile directly to
the theme's style.css file.
